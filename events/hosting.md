## Fallen Petals Event Hosting Guidelines

Welcome, host! Thank you for stepping up to lead a Fallen Petals event. These guidelines are here to help you run a smooth and enjoyable event for everyone.

### Ⅰ. Event Preparation

Before the event officially starts, a little preparation goes a long way.

- **Be Ready:** Log in a few minutes before the event's start time. Make sure your game is updated and you can connect without issues. Patches can happen unexpectedly!
- **Scout a Location:** Find a suitable spot for the car meet. Choose a location that won't interfere with other ongoing events, such as WQE's CCC.
- **Stock Up:** If you're leading tracks, make sure you have plenty of grenades for race starts. Everyone has a "Sufiii moment" and runs out eventually!

### Ⅱ. The Car Meet (~30 minutes)

The first part of the event is a relaxed car meet.

- **AFK Timer:** Gently remind attendees about the in-game AFK timer to prevent them from being kicked. A simple message in district chat works well:
  > _AFK TIMER REMINDER_
- **Group Picture:** The car meet part of the event concludes with a group picture, usually taken about 30 minutes in.

#### Media Handling

If you are responsible for taking photos and videos:

- **Shoot Early:** Take individual car pictures as people arrive. This ensures you capture everyone's car, even if they disconnect later.
- **Get Creative:** For the group picture, find a scenic or interesting angle to make the shot memorable.

### Ⅲ. Running Tracks

After the car meet, the main event begins: running drift tracks. We typically alternate tracks at a set frequency (e.g., every 30 minutes or after 3 runs).

A standard track run consists of:
1.  A **test lap** for everyone to learn the route.
2.  Sets of **two laps** for the actual run (unless decided otherwise).

#### Track Communication

Clear communication is key to keeping the event organized. Use a combination of district chat (`/d`) for general announcements and yells (`/y`) for local, start-line instructions.

> **Consistency is important!** While you can personalize your messages, sticking to this general format helps everyone know what's happening.

##### Announcing a New Track
Use the `FPC` prefix in district chat to distinguish your messages.
```
/d FPC >> CHANGING TRACKS: [TRACK NAME]
```

##### Starting a Race
1.  **Grid Up:** Announce the start in district chat to get everyone's attention.
    ```
    /d FPC: GRID UP!
    ```
    Or for a test lap:
    ```
    /d FPC: GRID UP FOR TEST LAP!
    ```
2.  **Ready Check:** Once people have gathered, use a local yell. Call out anyone who seems distracted.
    ```
    /y READY!
    ```
3.  **Launch:**
    - For a **test lap**, simply yell:
      ```
      /y TEST LAP!
      ```
    - For a **race**, announce the lap count, then use a grenade to signal the start.
      ```
      /y TWO LAPS!
      /y NADE OUT!
      ```

#### Leading a Test Lap

The test lap is crucial for members who don't know the track.

- **Keep the Pack Together:** While you can have fun and drift, your main goal is to demonstrate the track. Keep an eye on the group behind you and maintain a pace that allows everyone to keep up and not get lost.
- **Communicate Waits:** If you need to wait for someone, let the group know. You can use voice chat, your car horn, sirens, or blinkers. Other drivers will understand and either wait with you or continue on their own.

#### After the Run

- **Wait for Everyone:** Once a run is complete, wait for all attendees to reach the finish line before starting the next run or changing tracks.

### Ⅳ. General Hosting Etiquette

As a host, you are the point of contact for the event.

- **Stay Attentive:** Keep an eye on all chat channels (district, local, group, and whispers).
- **Welcome Newcomers:** If people join the district and ask what's happening, politely inform them about the FPC event (and any other events like CCC).
- **Multi-Hosting:** If there are multiple hosts, coordinate who will act as a "sweeper." This person stays at the back of the pack to help members who fall behind or flip their cars. Alternating this role ensures everyone gets to enjoy the event and no one feels left behind.

---

### Ⅴ. Coexisting with Other Events

Our community often shares districts with other groups, like CCC. It's important to be respectful and avoid conflicts.

- **Initial Track Choice:** When starting, pick a track that does not collide with any routes CCC is currently using.
- **Handling Mid-Event Changes:** Sometimes, another group might change tracks without much warning.
    1.  **Evaluate for Collisions:** Quickly check if their new track will interfere with yours. The `collide` web app is a great tool for this.
    2.  **Act if Necessary:** If there's a conflict, finish your current lap (or stop sooner if collisions are already happening).
    3.  **Announce the Change:** Inform the district that you are switching tracks to avoid issues.
        ```
        /d FPC >> CHANGING TO: [NEW TRACK NAME] to avoid collisions with CCC
        ```
